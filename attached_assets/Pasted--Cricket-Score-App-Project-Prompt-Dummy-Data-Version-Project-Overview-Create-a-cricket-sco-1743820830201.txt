# Cricket Score App Project Prompt (Dummy Data Version)

## Project Overview
Create a cricket score tracking web application similar to Cricbuzz or ESPNCricinfo using entirely dummy/static data. This project will be implemented in Replit and serve as a college project demonstration, showcasing web development skills without requiring any real-time data or API connections.

## Core Requirements
1. Develop a responsive web interface that works on both desktop and mobile screens
2. Display match scores and details using pre-created dummy data
3. Include at least one interactive feature (e.g., navigation between matches, team filtering)
4. Implement clean, well-commented code with proper structure
5. Focus on a polished UI/UX for the main features

## Key Features to Implement

### Homepage
- Display 3-5 "current" matches with teams, dummy scores, and match status
- Include a navigation menu for different sections
- Show 2-3 mock news headlines or highlights

### Match Detail Page
- Full scorecard with batting and bowling statistics (all dummy data)
- Simple match commentary highlights (pre-written)
- Match summary with key performers
- Basic match visualization (run rate chart or similar)

### Teams Section
- List of 6-8 major cricket teams with logos and basic info
- Mock team rankings
- Fictional recent performance data

### Player Profiles
- 3-5 featured players with fictional statistics
- Player images and short bios
- Career highlights (all pre-created)

### Search Functionality
- Simple search for finding pre-loaded matches, players, or teams

## Technical Guidelines
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend
- Store all dummy data in JSON format files within your project
- Implement responsive design using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Add comments explaining the code logic and structure
- No need for backend connections or real-time updates

## Data Creation Guidelines
- Create realistic but fictional match scenarios
- Include some interesting situations like close finishes or high scores
- Pre-populate all statistics, no calculations needed
- Create 2-3 "tournaments" with 3-4 matches each

## Deliverables
1. Functional cricket score web application with dummy data
2. Brief documentation explaining the features and implementation
3. Project presentation slides highlighting key features and design decisions

This project demonstrates your ability to create a well-designed, structured web application while focusing on the user experience rather than backend functionality.
